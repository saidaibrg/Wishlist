## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

The main challenge was to understand the pipeline of the RecycleView. I took some time to figure out how Adapter is connected to the LayoutView, the MainActivity files, and how each of the Item classes could be integrated into a big picture. Additionally, it took me a while to understand the functionality of wrap_content vs match_parameter parameters in the .xml files.
